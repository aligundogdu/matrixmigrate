# MatrixMigrate Application Service Registration
# 
# This file must be registered with your Synapse homeserver to enable
# message import with original timestamps.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Generate tokens (you can use: openssl rand -hex 32)
# 2. Copy this file to your Synapse server (e.g., /etc/matrix-synapse/matrixmigrate.yaml)
# 3. Add to homeserver.yaml: app_service_config_files: ["/etc/matrix-synapse/matrixmigrate.yaml"]
# 4. Restart Synapse
# 5. Add the as_token to your MatrixMigrate config.yaml

id: matrixmigrate
url: null  # No callback URL needed - this is outbound-only

# Generate these tokens with: openssl rand -hex 32
as_token: "REPLACE_WITH_GENERATED_TOKEN"
hs_token: "REPLACE_WITH_GENERATED_TOKEN"

# The localpart of the user the AS will masquerade as
sender_localpart: matrixmigrate

# Rate limiting is disabled for application services by default
rate_limited: false

# We don't need to reserve any namespaces since we're just sending messages
namespaces:
  users: []
  rooms: []
  aliases: []
